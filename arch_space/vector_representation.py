"""
Vector representation of neural architectures.

This module provides the core functionality for encoding and decoding neural
architectures as continuous vectors. The vector space representation enables:
- Smooth interpolation between architectures
- Gradient-based optimization
- Distance metrics between architectures
- Clustering and visualization

Example:
    >>> arch_vector = ArchitectureVector(dimensions=64)
    >>> arch_spec = {
    ...     "num_layers": 4,
    ...     "hidden_size": 256,
    ...     "num_heads": 8,
    ...     "ffn_type": "gated"
    ... }
    >>> arch_vector.encode(arch_spec)
    >>> mutated = arch_vector.mutate(mutation_rate=0.1)
    >>> new_spec = mutated.decode()
