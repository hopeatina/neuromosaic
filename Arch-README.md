This structure aims to separate concerns cleanly, allowing contributors to focus on one area (e.g., adding a new LLM provider or a new architecture encoder) without disrupting the entire system.

Component-by-Component Breakdown

1. Orchestrator
   Purpose:

Manages the lifecycle of experiments: requests new architectures, triggers code generation, schedules training runs, and records results.
Implements a “Control Loop” that interacts with all other components.
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Strategy Pattern for Search Methods: The orchestrator can load different “search strategies” (random, Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms) from orchestrator/strategies/. The orchestrator chooses which strategy to apply or can combine them.
Observer Pattern for Result Updates: The orchestrator can observe changes in the results database to decide when to trigger the next experiment.
Interfaces:

IOrchestrator: A high-level interface that defines methods like run_cycle(), get_next_architecture(), submit_results().
Strategy interfaces: ISearchStrategy with methods like suggest_architecture(), update_with_results().
Data Flow:

Orchestrator calls ISearchStrategy.suggest_architecture() -> receives a vector representing architecture.
Passes vector to LLM code gen, receives generated code.
Calls env_manager to run training in a container.
After training, retrieves metrics from results_db.
Updates strategy with update_with_results() and repeats. 2. Architecture Vector Space Representation
Purpose:

Defines how architectures are represented as vectors and how to transform these vectors into a structured specification (e.g., a dictionary describing layers, attention types, etc.).
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Factory Pattern for Encoders/Decoders: Different subsets of architectures or new components can be added as plugins. Factories instantiate the right encoder/decoder classes based on configuration.
Composite Pattern for Architecture Composition: Complex architectures built from multiple components (attention modules, FFN modules) can be combined compositely.
Interfaces:

IArchitectureEncoder: Given a specification dict, produce a vector (or vice versa).
IArchitectureDecoder: Given a vector, produce a specification dict suitable for LLM prompting.
Data Flow:

Orchestrator requests a new architecture: ISearchStrategy returns a vector.
arch_space uses IArchitectureDecoder to turn vector into a spec dict.
After experiments, to store results, IArchitectureEncoder might help encode architecture for meta-analysis. 3. LLM Code Generation
Purpose:

Converts the architecture specification into runnable PyTorch code using prompts and an LLM.
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Adapter Pattern for LLM Providers: A common ICodeGenProvider interface that allows switching between a local LLaMA, GPT-4 API, or other backends without changing orchestrator code.
Template Method Pattern for prompts: Abstract prompt generation steps into a base class, with customizable templates for different architecture variants.
Interfaces:

ICodeGenProvider: generate_code(architecture_spec) -> str
IPromptTemplate: build_prompt(architecture_spec) -> str
Data Flow:

Given an architecture_spec from arch_space, llm_code_gen picks a provider (e.g., providers/llama.py) and a template.
ICodeGenProvider.generate_code() returns the code snippet.
The orchestrator receives code, ready to be passed to env_manager. 4. Environment & Container Manager
Purpose:

Runs experiments in isolated containers to ensure reproducibility and consistent environments.
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Facade Pattern: A single IEnvironmentManager interface hides complexity of container orchestration, whether using Docker, Podman, or Kubernetes.
Factory Pattern: For generating containers with different base images or GPU/CPU resource configurations.
Interfaces:

IEnvironmentManager: run_experiment(code: str, config: dict) -> run_id
Data Flow:

Orchestrator provides code and a config (datasets, hyperparams).
env_manager builds a container, mounts volumes, copies code in, runs training script.
Once complete, logs and metrics go to results_db. 5. Training & Evaluation
Purpose:

Standardized training loops and evaluation metrics for each experiment.
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Strategy Pattern for tasks: Different tasks (language modeling, classification) implemented as separate strategies.
Observer Pattern for metrics: Metrics logged via callbacks and observers.
Interfaces:

ITrainer: train_model(model, dataset, hyperparams) -> metrics
ITask: prepare_data() -> dataset, postprocess_outputs(), etc.
IMetric: compute(predictions, targets) -> value
Data Flow:

Code from LLM is dynamically loaded as a model class.
ITask.prepare_data() provides a dataset.
ITrainer.train_model() runs training, logs metrics, and returns a results dict. 6. Results Database
Purpose:

Central store for architecture specs, run configurations, metrics, logs, and code versions.
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Repository Pattern: Abstract database operations behind a repository interface, allowing easy switching from SQLite to another DB.
Data Access Objects (DAO): Classes to read/write experiment runs, metrics, and architecture vectors.
Interfaces:

IResultsDB: save_run_info(...), get_best_architectures(...), list_all_runs(...)
Data Flow:

After each run, orchestrator calls results_db to store metrics and config.
Meta-learning queries results_db to get historical data and guide future searches. 7. Meta-Learning & Visualization Tools
Purpose:

Analyze stored results, build heatmaps and projections, guide optimization to promising regions.
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Strategy Pattern for optimization algorithms (Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms).
Decorator Pattern for adding new analysis modules on top of base queries.
Interpreter Pattern if complex query logic evolves (transforming data queries into visualizable forms).
Interfaces:

IMetaLearner: update_strategies_with_results(results), generate_recommendations()
IVisualizer: plot_performance_landscape(results)
Data Flow:

Periodically, orchestrator triggers meta_learning scripts.
They query results_db, run analysis (e.g., dimension reduction to map architectures into 2D), produce heatmaps.
Insights feed back into the orchestrator’s chosen ISearchStrategy. 8. Utilities (Config, Logging, Version Control)
Purpose:

Provide cross-cutting functionalities like configuration, logging, and version control integration.
Design Patterns & Concepts:

Singleton or Dependency Injection for global configuration management.
Command Pattern for version control actions (commit, checkout specific code versions).
Bridge Pattern if multiple version control systems are supported.
Interfaces:

IConfigManager: centralized access to config variables (like which LLM to use, DB path, etc.)
IVersionControl: methods to record and retrieve the code version (commit hash) associated with each run.
Data Flow:

Before each run, orchestrator queries config for LLM backend, sets environment variables for container runs.
After code generation, IVersionControl commits the generated code snapshot, tagging it with run_id.
Interactions and Collaboration Patterns
Adding a New Architectural Component:
Contributor adds a new encoder/decoder class in arch_space/encoders/ or arch_space/decoders/. They implement the IArchitectureEncoder or IArchitectureDecoder interface. Now the orchestrator can incorporate this new component into the search space easily.

Introducing a New LLM Provider:
Contributor creates a new ICodeGenProvider in llm_code_gen/providers/. The orchestrator can pick it via a config file change, no core code modifications needed.

Changing the Search Strategy:
Contributor adds a new strategy in orchestrator/strategies/, implementing ISearchStrategy. The orchestrator can switch strategies by a single config change.

Enhanced Visualization Method:
Add a new visualization tool in meta_learning/visualization.py implementing IVisualizer. This tool can be run as part of the analysis cycle.

Database Migration:
If switching from SQLite to Postgres, implement a new IResultsDB adapter in results_db/, and point config to use it. The rest of the system remains unchanged.
