# Welcome to Neuromosaic

Neuromosaic is an innovative platform for exploring and optimizing neural network architectures through interactive visualization and meta-learning. By representing architectures as points in a continuous space, we enable intuitive exploration and efficient optimization of neural network designs.

## Core Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Explore architecture embeddings in an intuitive 3D space
- **Meta-Learning Optimization**: Leverage past experiments to guide future architecture searches
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track experiments and metrics through an interactive dashboard
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily add new architecture types and search strategies

## The Architecture Space

At the heart of Neuromosaic is the concept of representing neural architectures as points in a continuous space. Imagine a 3D sphere where:

- Each point represents a unique architecture configuration
- Similar architectures cluster together
- Performance metrics create a landscape over this space
- Meta-learning helps navigate towards optimal regions

This intuitive representation enables both visual exploration and efficient optimization of the architecture search space.
