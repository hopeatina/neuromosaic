title: "The Sphere Metaphor"
description: "Understanding NeuroMosaic's unique approach to neural architecture representation"
---

<Note>
  The sphere metaphor is a fundamental concept in NeuroMosaic that enables intuitive navigation of the neural architecture space.
</Note>

## Core Concept

<Info>
  NeuroMosaic maps neural architectures onto a hypersphere, where:
  - Similar architectures are close together
  - Distance represents architectural differences
  - Surface coverage indicates exploration completeness
</Info>

## Mathematical Foundation

<Accordion title="Spherical Embedding">
  The embedding process involves:
  1. Dimension reduction through architectural encoding
  2. Normalization to unit sphere
  3. Preservation of architectural topology
  4. Distance metric optimization
</Accordion>

<CodeGroup>
```python Embedding Example
from neuromosaic.embedding import SphereEmbedding

# Create embedding

embedding = SphereEmbedding(dimension=128)

# Embed architecture

vector = embedding.encode(architecture)
normalized = embedding.project_to_sphere(vector)

````

```python Distance Computation
# Compute geodesic distance
distance = embedding.geodesic_distance(arch1, arch2)

# Find nearest neighbors
neighbors = embedding.find_nearest(
    query_arch,
    k=5,
    metric="geodesic"
)
````

## Implementation Details

<Accordion title="Embedding Algorithm">
```python
def create_sphere_embedding(architecture):
    # 1. Extract features
    features = extract_architectural_features(architecture)
    
    # 2. Reduce dimensionality
    reduced = reduce_dimensions(features, target_dim=128)

<Accordion title="Distance Metrics">
```python
def compute_distances(arch1, arch2):
    # Euclidean distance in embedding space
    euclidean = np.linalg.norm(
        arch1.embedding - arch2.embedding
    )
    
    # Geodesic distance on sphere
    geodesic = compute_geodesic_distance(
        arch1.embedding,
        arch2.embedding
    )
    
    return euclidean, geodesic
```
