## Setup Guide (Coming Soon)

<Steps>
  1. **Configure Cluster**
     ```python
     # Coming Soon
     from neuromosaic.distributed import Cluster
     
     cluster = Cluster(
         master_node="master.example.com",
         worker_nodes=[
             "worker1.example.com",
             "worker2.example.com"
         ],
         ssh_config="~/.ssh/config"
     )
     ```

2. **Define Resources**

   ```python
   # Coming Soon
   resources = {
       "gpu_type": "nvidia-t4",
       "gpus_per_node": 4,
       "cpu_cores": 32,
       "memory": "64GB",
       "storage": "1TB"
   }
   ```

3. **Launch Cluster**
   ```python
   # Coming Soon
   cluster.launch(
       resources=resources,
       auto_scale=True,
       min_nodes=1,
       max_nodes=10
   )
   ```
   </Steps>

## Fault Tolerance (Coming Soon)

<Warning>
  Distributed systems must handle various failure scenarios gracefully. This
  feature is planned for future releases.
</Warning>

  Automatic handling of: - Worker disconnections - Task reassignment - State
  recovery - Result preservation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Issues">

  Partial failures
</Accordion>

## Monitoring (Coming Soon)

<CodeGroup>
```python Cluster Status
# Coming Soon
from neuromosaic.monitoring import ClusterMonitor

monitor = ClusterMonitor(cluster)
status = monitor.get_status()

print(f"Active nodes: {status.active_nodes}")
print(f"GPU utilization: {status.gpu_utilization}%")
print(f"Memory usage: {status.memory_usage}GB")

````

```python Performance Metrics
# Coming Soon
metrics = monitor.get_metrics()

print(f"Training throughput: {metrics.samples_per_second}")
print(f"Communication overhead: {metrics.network_time}ms")
print(f"Resource efficiency: {metrics.resource_utilization}%")
````
