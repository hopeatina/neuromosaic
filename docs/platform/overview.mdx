## Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```python Core Engine
from neuromosaic.engine import SearchEngine
from neuromosaic.config import SearchConfig

# Initialize search engine

engine = SearchEngine(
config=SearchConfig(
search_space="transformer",
objectives=["accuracy", "latency"],
constraints={"max_params": 1e8}
)
)

# Start search

results = engine.run(
max_trials=1000,
parallel_workers=8
)

````

```python Distribution
from neuromosaic.distributed import Cluster

# Set up distributed cluster
cluster = Cluster(
    nodes=["gpu-1", "gpu-2", "gpu-3"],
    resources_per_node={
        "gpu": 4,
        "cpu": 32,
        "memory": "64GB"
    }
)

# Launch distributed search
distributed_results = engine.run_distributed(
    cluster=cluster,
    sync_interval="10s"
)
````
